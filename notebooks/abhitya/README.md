2024-02-08 - General Research and Proposal Writing
==================================================

Did some work prior to this date, helping look for for parts that would work with project and conducting general research that was required for the subsystems.

Worked with teammates on the project proposal, helped define and flesh out some of the subsystem requirements. Researched and wrote the ethics and safety portion of the proposal. Also helped out with general edits and provided feedback wherever necessary throughout the document. Helped out with some research regarding the MCU as we needed to decide between the STM32 and ESP32 as I would be taking the lead on the application if we were to end up using the ESP.

Additionally wrote the entire team contract for the project and shared with the team members in order to get their signatures on their versions and submit it individually.
